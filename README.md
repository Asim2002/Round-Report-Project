# Round-Report-Project
An app I created for my IB Internal Assessment to help my debate coach by creating reports with online information about debate rounds. It requires multiple files, but these files contain sensitive information and were not included in this repository. If you need to see the program function, contact me at asimadhikari1997@gmail.com. This program utilizes Selenium WebDriver for web automation and data extraction. The GUI was created using Netbeans Drag and Drop IDE. If you would like to see citations from the research I did during the process, please contact me.
